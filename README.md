# Simple TODO app (with User login)

Simple TODO app but rather than just storing task in React state, it has a functionality to store tasks to a PosgreSQL database. To store a task, user has to be loged in. Authentication and authorization are handled via [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)

## How to use?

This app shows data about all countries in the world. Home Page show all the countries fetch from [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and some basic information about them. There is an option to serach for specific country or filter them by continent. You can click on a specific country or visit [https://discover-countries-redsync.netlify.app/country/{country-alpha3Code}] to get more information about specific country. There is also an option to change a theme color to "Dark" or "Light"

## How it works?

I've used [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to fetch information about countries and then display it on screen. There is also an option to select specific country and see more detailed infomration.
